  I'm interested in artificial intelligence and algorithms.
  Recently, I've been working on [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20a%20Voronoi%20diagram,%2C%20sites%2C%20or%20generators) 
  and shortest paths under the $L_1$ metric.
  
  I have experience with <mark>pytorch</mark> <mark>SQL</mark> and <mark>Ipe</mark>(Geometric objects drawing tool).

          [Abstract] In this paper, we present an algorithm to compute $L_1$ shortest paths between two vertical or horizontal line segments avoiding $n$ axis-aligned rectangular obstacles.
          The suggested algorithm computes the minimum shortest path in $O(n \log n)$ time using $O(n)$ space and the maximum shortest path in $O(n^2)$ time and $O(n^2)$ space.

          [Abstract] We present an algorithm to compute the geodesic $L_1$ farthest-point Voronoi diagram of $m$ point sites 
          in the presence of $n$ rectangular obstacles in the plane. It takes $O(nm + n \log n + m \log m)$ construction time using $O(nm)$ space.
          This is the first optimal algorithm for constructing the farthest-point Voronoi diagram in the presence of rectangular obstacles. 
          We can construct a data structure in the same construction time and space that answer a farthest-neighbor query in $O(\log(n+m)) time.

        title: Design and Implementation of Word Classes Embedding for Improving FastText

          [Abstract] Compared to English, 
          Korean has many types of conjugation due to the nature of the language. 
          Depending on the word embedding technique, 
          there is a clear difference in the performance of the NLP model. 
          Therefore, in this paper, we propose WCE (Word Classes Embedding), 
          a new word embedding technique that supplements fastText to be suitable for learning Korean sentence structure. 
          WCE is an improved method for better learning part-of-speech information 
          by adding part-of-speech information of words to the fastText-based embedding dimension.
