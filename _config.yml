  I'm interested in artificial intelligence and algorithms.
  For my recent research area, I've been working on [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20a%20Voronoi%20diagram,%2C%20sites%2C%20or%20generators) 
  and shortest paths under the $L_1$ metric.
  I have experience with <mark>pytorch</mark>, <mark>SQL</mark> and <mark>Ipe</mark>(Geometric objects drawing tool).

          In this paper, we present an algorithm to compute $L_1$ shortest paths between two vertical or horizontal line segments avoiding $n$ axis-aligned rectangular obstacles.
          The suggested algorithm computes the minimum shortest path in $O(n \log n)$ time using $O(n)$ space and the maximum shortest path in $O(n^2)$ time and $O(n^2)$ space.
